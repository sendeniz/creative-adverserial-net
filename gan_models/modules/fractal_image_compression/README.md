# fractal-image-compression

A very simple implementation of fractal image compression.

I wrote an [article](https://pvigier.github.io/2018/05/14/fractal-image-compression.html) on my blog that explains the theory behind fractal image compression and how the code works. Feel free to read it!

## Examples

The script can compress and decompress greyscale images.

But also RGB images by applying the algorithm to the three channels.
