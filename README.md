wikiart_subset:
    The wikiart_subset folder consists of the following art style: [Analytica_Cubism, Cubism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Synthetic_Cubism].
    This folder is not included in the repo, but can be downloaded from https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zg-1Ax32rG3L3xqR_5bwmiHQzlH4CR6h?usp=sharing
    
artemis:
    The artemis folder is the copy of original repo by Panos https://github.com/optas/artemis. Please follow the installation guide on in the original repo to ensure
    dependecies are installed. This is requiered to obtain a deep cleaned .csv file of the emotional reponses to train neural networks on.
    
notebooks:
    Currently slight adjustment to the notebook folder was made to accomodate the wikiart_subset data for 1) selecting a random artwork and depicting its emotional
    response and 2) select a random artwork based on a genre i.e. portrait, landscape etc.
