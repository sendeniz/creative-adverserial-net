### Description:
1. wikiart_subset:
    The wikiart_subset folder consists of the following art style: [Analytica_Cubism, Cubism, Expressionism, Fauvism, Synthetic_Cubism] and consists of 10231
    artworks for testing generative models.
    This folder is not included in the repo, but can be downloaded from [https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Zg-1Ax32rG3L3xqR_5bwmiHQzlH4CR6h?usp=sharing]
    
2. artemis:
    The artemis repo from https://github.com/optas/artemis is included. Please follow the installation guide (step 1-2) in below or from the original   
    repo to ensure dependecies are installed and so that a deep cleaned .csv file of the emotional reponses to train neural networks on can be obtained. There 	
    are 3 version of the emotion annotated art data provided in artemis: 1) raw (uncleaned), 2) slight cleaning and 3) deep cleaned (used for training neural 	
    nets in the original paper).
    
3. notebooks:
    Currently slight adjustment to the notebook folder was made to accomodate the wikiart_subset data for 1) selecting a random artwork and depicting its 
    emotional response and 2) select a random artwork based on a genre i.e. portrait, landscape etc.

### Dataset
To get the most out of this repo, please __download__ the data associated with ArtEmis, by filling this [form](https://forms.gle/7eqiRgb764uTuexd7).

### Installation
This code has been tested with Python 3.6.9, Pytorch 1.3.1, CUDA 10.0 on Ubuntu 16.04.

Assuming some (potentially) virtual environment and __python 3x__ 
```Console
git clone https://github.com/optas/artemis.git
cd artemis
pip install -e .
```
This will install the repo with all its dependencies (listed in setup.py) and will enable you to do things like:
``` 
from artemis.models import xx
```   
(provided you add this artemis repo in your PYTHON-PATH) 
  
### Playing with ArtEmis 

#### Step-1 (important &nbsp; :pushpin:) 

 __Preprocess the provided annotations__ (spell-check, patch, tokenize, make train/val/test splits, etc.).
 ```Console 
    artemis/scripts/preprocess_artemis_data.py
 ```
This script allows you to preprocess ArtEmis according to your needs. The __default__ arguments will do __minimal__ 
preprocessing so the resulting output can be used to _fairly_ compare ArtEmis with other datasets; and, derive most _faithful_ statistics 
about ArtEmis's nature. That is what we used in our __analysis__ and what you should use in "Step-2" below. With this in mind do: 
  ```Console 
    python artemis/scripts/preprocess_artemis_data.py -save-out-dir <ADD_YOURS> -raw-artemis-data-csv <ADD_YOURS>
 ```

If you wish to train __deep-nets__ (speakers, emotion-classifiers etc.) *exactly* as we did it in our paper, then you need to rerun this script
by providing only a single extra optional argument ("__--preprocess-for-deep-nets True__"). This will do more aggressive filtering and you should use its output for
"Steps-3" and "Steps-4" below (please use a new save-out-dir to avoid overwriting).  
  ```Console 
    python artemis/scripts/preprocess_artemis_data.py -save-out-dir <ADD_YOURS> -raw-artemis-data-csv <ADD_YOURS> --preprocess-for-deep-nets True
 ```   
(If you wish to understand the nature of the different hyper-parameters please read the details in the provided _help_ messages of the used argparse.)   

#### Step-2
__Analyze & explore the dataset__. :microscope:

Using the _minimally_ preprocessed version of ArtEmis which includes __all__ (454,684) collected annotation. 
   
   1. This is a great place to __start__ :checkered_flag:. Run this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/analysis/analyzing_artemis.ipynb) to do basic _linguistic_, _emotion_ & _art-oriented_ __analysis__ of the ArtEmis dataset.
   2. Please run this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/analysis/concreteness_subjectivity_sentiment_and_POS.ipynb) to analyze ArtEmis in terms of its: _concreteness_, _subjectivity_, _sentiment_ and _Parts-of-Speech_. Optionally, contrast these values with 
   with other common datasets like COCO.
   3. Please run this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/analysis/extract_emotion_histogram_per_image.ipynb) to extract the _emotion histograms_ (empirical distributions) of each artwork. This in __necessary__ for the Step-3 (1).
   4. Please run this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/analysis/emotion_entropy_per_genre_or_artstyle.ipynb) to analyze the extracted emotion histograms (previous step) per art genre and style.  
 
#### Step-3

__Train and evaluate emotion-centric image & text classifiers__. :hearts:

(Using the preprocessed version of ArtEmis for __deep-nets__ which includes 429,431 annotations. Training on a single GPU from scratch is a matter of _minutes_ for these classifiers!)

   1. Please run this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/deep_nets/emotions/image_to_emotion_classifier.ipynb) to train an __image-to-emotion__ classifier.
   2. Please run this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/deep_nets/emotions/utterance_to_emotion_classifier.ipynb) to train an LSTM-based __utterance-to-emotion__ classifier. Or, this [notebook](artemis/notebooks/deep_nets/emotions/utterance_to_emotion_with_transformer.ipynb) to train a BERT-based one.          
   
    
#### Step-4
__Train & evaluate neural-speakers.__ :bomb:
   
   - To __train__ our customized SAT model on ArtEmis  (__~2 hours__ to train in a single GPU!) do:
```Console 
    python artemis/scripts/train_speaker.py -log-dir <ADD_YOURS> -data-dir <ADD_YOURS> -img-dir <ADD_YOURS>

    log-dir: where to save the output of the training process, models etc.
    data-dir: directory you used as _input_  (termed -save-dir) when you run the preprocess_artemis_data.py
              the directory should contain the ouput of preprocess_artemis_data.csv: e.g., 
               the artemis_preprocessed.csv, the vocabulary.pkl
    img-dir: the top folder containing the WikiArt image dataset in its "standard" format:
                img-dir/art_style/painting-xx.jpg
```
    
   Note. The default optional arguments will create the same vanilla-speaker variant we used in our paper.           
   
  - To __train__ the __emotionally-grounded__ variant of SAT add one parameter in the above call:
```Console 
    python artemis/scripts/train_speaker.py -log-dir <ADD_YOURS> -data-dir <ADD_YOURS> -img-dir <ADD_YOURS>
                                            --use-emo-grounding True
```
   - To __sample__ utterances for a trained speaker:
   ```Console 
    python artemis/scripts/sample_speaker.py -arguments
   ```
   For an explanation of the arguments see the argparse help messages. It worth noting that if you 
   want to sample an emotionally-grounded variant you also need to provide a pretrained image2emotion 
   classifier that will be used to extract _the most likely_ emotion of each image as grounding input to 
   the speaker. See Step-3 (1) for how to train such a net.
   
   - To __evaluate__ the sampled utterances of a speaker (e.g., per BLEU, emotional alignment, methaphors etc.) use this 
   [notebook](artemis/notebooks/deep_nets/speakers/evaluate_sampled_captions.ipynb). As bonus you can see the _neural attention_ placed on 
   the different tokens/images.
